# How to Play GUESSY

A word-guessing game where the goal is to guess a hidden five-letter word. Here's how you can play:

1. **Guess a Word:**
   - Each guess you make must be a valid five-letter word.

2. **Tile Colors:**
   - The color of each tile will change to provide feedback on the accuracy of your guess.

3. **Green Tile:**
   - If a tile turns green, it means the letter is in the word, and it is in the correct spot.

4. **Yellow Tile:**
   - If a tile turns yellow, it indicates that the letter is in the word, but it is not in the correct spot.

5. **Gray Tile:**
   - If a tile turns gray, it means the letter is not in the word.

### Example Guesses:

- If you guess "APPLE" and the first tile turns green, it means the first letter in your guess is in the correct spot.
  
- If the second tile turns yellow, it means the second letter is in the word but not in the correct spot.

- If the third tile turns gray, it means the third letter is not in the word.

Continue making guesses and interpreting the tile colors to uncover the hidden word.

Have fun playing GUESSY!
